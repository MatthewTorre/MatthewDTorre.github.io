Developed a framework uniting quantum algorithms with modern AI, focusing on applications in finance. Implemented case studies with Grover’s, Shor’s, quantum clustering, kernel methods, and QAOA, analyzing performance tradeoffs and feasibility. Produced a roadmap for enterprise-ready, quantum-enhanced AI systems.
