Built Synced-In, an AI-powered internal tool for natural language expert search. Designed a retrieval-augmented architecture with Flask, semantic search, and keyword extraction, plus modular APIs for LLM integration and future enterprise integrations (Workday, Jira, Confluence, Teams). Pitched to 190+ leaders, finishing top 10 of 140+ teams.
